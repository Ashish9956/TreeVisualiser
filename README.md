# BinaryTreeVisualiser
# Visual Data Insight | Binary Tree Visualizer

## Overview

 the Visual Data Insight project focused on creating an interactive Binary Tree Visualizer. This tool showcases three hierarchical tree structures, namely a Binary Tree, a Max Heap, and a Binary Search Tree. The project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an engaging and informative experience for users exploring these common tree structures.

## Features

- **Three Tree Structures:**
  - **Binary Tree:** Explore the properties of a binary tree with its unique hierarchical arrangement of nodes.
  - **Max Heap:** Visualize a max heap, a specialized binary tree where each parent node has a value greater than or equal to its children.
  - **Binary Search Tree:** Understand the principles of a binary search tree, where each node has at most two child nodes, and the left subtree is less than the parent, while the right subtree is greater.

- **Interactive Visualization:**
  - Interact with the visualizations to understand the relationships between nodes in each tree structure.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - An intuitive and user-friendly interface allows for easy navigation and exploration of the tree visualizations.
